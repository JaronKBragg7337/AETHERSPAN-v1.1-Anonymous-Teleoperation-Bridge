# AETHERSPAN-v1.1-Anonymous-Teleoperation-Bridge
AETHERSPAN is a local-first, anonymous WebSocket bridge for real-time teleoperation. It maps controller input to a device adapter, returns state/receipts in real time, and logs activity into an append-only, hash-chained SQLite ledger. It also supports optional peer messaging, optional sync, and optional usage-based billing (credits).
